### Abstract 

The factors that influence the success of movies are various and complex, involving elements such as ratings, reviews, box-office revenues, and popularity. This paper aims to analyze these factors using data science tools to uncover patterns and relationships that may help provide valuable insights to filmmakers and studios for quality US domestic movies. Our analysis shows that the three factor pairs including user rating and professional critic score, user rating and revenue, runtime and revenue all have moderately positive correlations, while release month has no significant influence on movie revenues, although December is considered to be the most advantageous month in our data sample. Additionally, we find that Adventure, Sci-Fi, and Animation are the most profitable genres.
